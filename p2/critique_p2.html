The red and white colors will draw your attention but the black objects (the font) is easily distinguishable and organized. The only difference I’d make is if the front screen was an offer like “new burger for X amount” or something, this way it would make me want to press the order button more, and makes it more relevant. </p><h1><img src="res2.png" alt="McDonalds"></h1><h2><a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us.html">           McDonalds</a></h2><h2>Critique</h2><p>I think this website needs more color and it doesn’t really feel like McDonalds at all. I think they should do a red, yellow, and black color scheme. The red and yellow could be used for burgers/offers, while the black could be used for the navigation bar. I do like that they put a offer as soon as  you enter the website. However, i think they focused on function over design.</p><h1><img src="res3.png" alt="BurgerKing"></h1><h2><a href="https://www.bk.com/">          Burger King</a></h2><h2>Critique</h2> <p>I like that the website puts a huge burger to entice you to buy things, and just below it are offers. However, I think the offers should be on top, and next to the offers should be a “order this” button. This way it would make it for user to order specific things right away since that’s the reason for them to enter the site in the first place. </p><h1><img src="pizzagyro.png" alt="PizzaGyro"></h1><h2><a href="http://www.pizzaandgyro.com/">          Pizza and Gyro</a></h2><h2>Critique</h2> <p>I’ve been to pizza and gyro a lot and order a lot from their website. I like the layout of their websites however they need to put accurate images for their food. A lot of the food have the same picture, an example are sandwiches. There is only a small description but otherwise you don’t know what it looks like. </p><h1><img src="dera.png" alt="dera"></h1><h2><a href="http://deraspringfield.com/">          Dera</a></h2><h2>Critique</h2> <p>This is my favorite restaurant website because it’s a Pakistani restaurant and the websites design gives a cultural feeling. I really like that they have different categories in the front like most popular, best of the week, etc. because it allows new customers to choose foods easily since they know those items are in demand. The main critique I have for the website is that there is a large white strip where there is supposed to be photos. It takes extremely long for it to load since it’s a slideshow of picture. They should simply take a photo of their food that would go with the design layout.</p></body></html>
