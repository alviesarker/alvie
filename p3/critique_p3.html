From the getgo you know the person is a designer and you feel the "designing" aspect from the layout of the website. Instead of the meny bar being on the top, it's on the bottom and you press the arrows on the sides to navigate, or press on the icons. This design always keeps you inside the expierence because you never have to scroll away. It reminds me of a well designed powerpoint, which a portfolio is like. I like that the contact links are just below his qualifications and that it's the first thing you see. The only con I would say is that I think he  should somehoe ad a visual to his homepage, it would add a bit more life to his website. </p><h1><img src="Gameport2.png" alt="Gameport2"></h1><h2><a href="http://www.davidshaver.net">          Game Designer</a></h2><h2>Critique</h2><p>The layout of the website is well done but does feel a little basic. However, I like that all his past work is in the front page so an employer can see everything from the beginning. At first I wasn't a fan of the dark design but it actually matches the dark/mature feeling of the video games he's designed in the past. On change I would make is that the text color should be consistant because it's hard to read gray text on a dark background. </p><h1><img src="Gameport3.png" alt="Gameport3"></h1><h2><a href="http://www.michaellevall.com">          Game Design</a></h2><h2>Critique</h2><p>This website is good and I like that alot of his work is on the fron page. I don't think there anything that sticks out about the design of the webite, I think they could have designed the menu bar a bit better so that it would look more creative. </p><h1><img src="Gameport4.png" alt="Gameport4"></h1><h2><a href="http://nicolaskraj.com">          Game and UX Designer</a></h2><h2>Critique</h2><p>This website is really well done but it's expected from someone who is a UX designer. As you scroll down the website his qualifications are neatly listed with graphics to help the user understand his strengths and weaknesses. The transitions that are used when scrolling down are really nice making the expierence seamless. All needed information is shown as you scroll down. It's really hard to crtique someone who's an expert in UX. The only criticism I have is that he only has his linkedin page on the bottom. If he does have anycother social media I think he should add it so if someone wanted to search him up then can get an idea of how he is as a person. </p><h1><img src="Gameport5.png" alt="Gameport5"></h1><h2><a href="http://www.nathaliejankie.nl">          Game Design</a></h2><h2>Critique</h2><p>I think this website is really well designed because of the UX. When scrolling down, the menu bar will turn black and follow you down, it's a good way to remind you to look at the other tabs. All the social media links are there right when you enter the website. Another plus is that the layout their work experience at the bottom, list out specifically what they did on the probject, and then embed a video to show it. It's a good way to deliver an good UX to the user. I think a dark background with white font is harder on the eyes, if they were to change the color scheme I think the website would be better. Otherwise, they did a really good job. </p></body></html>
